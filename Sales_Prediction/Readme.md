# Sales prediction using Sales data:

Used Supermarket Sales from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/roopacalistus/superstore

The data contains sales details of different stores of a supermarket chain that has multiple stores in different parts of the US.

We used various and implemented various Supervised Learning Algorithms:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest Regressor
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression

We used the above algorithms to compare the results of the inbuilt and one implemented by us. The overall aim was to understand the appropriate usage of supervised algorithms in these type of situations and key takeaways of how linear models such as linear regression fair up against non-linear models such as Decision tree in a highly non-linear data. Overall this project enhanced my understanding on supervised algorithms and the mathematical intuition behind it.

Apart from the ML takeaways, this project helped me understand:
- Importance of Experimental Data Analysis & Data Visualization
- Choosing appropriate feature engineering models to accelerate our model's accuracy.

That's all enjoy!
