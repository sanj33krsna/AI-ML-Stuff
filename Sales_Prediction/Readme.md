# Sales prediction using Sales data:

Used Supermarket Sales from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/roopacalistus/superstore

The data contains sales details of different stores of a supermarket chain that has multiple stores in different parts of the US.

We used various and implemented various Supervised Learning Algorithms:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest Regressor
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression

We used the above algorithms to compare the results of the inbuilt and one implemented by us. The overall aim was to understand the appropriate usage of supervised algorithms in these type of situations and key takeaways of how linear models such as linear regression fair up against non-linear models such as Decision tree in a highly non-linear data. Apart from this the project helped me understand how these supervised algorithms work and the mathematic intuition behind it.
