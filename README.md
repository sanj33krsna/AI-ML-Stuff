# AI-ML Projects with Description:

<strong><a href=https://github.com/sanj33krsna/AI-ML-Stuff/tree/main/Code-Bot-PowerBot> PowerBot: </a></strong>
<br>
OpenAI GPT-3 based chatbot used to assist users with query related to **conserving energy** and promoting the use of **sustainable solutions**. It uses streamlit and langchain framework. **Prompt Engineering** techniques used to provide appropriate output to user's query, in this case sustainable development based query's and answers. LLM properties such as history etc implemented.
<br>
<br>
<strong><a href=https://github.com/sanj33krsna/AI-ML-Stuff/tree/main/Sales_Prediction> Sales Analysis: </a></strong>
<br>
Using **Sci-kit Learn** and **Pandas** to do analysis on **sales data**. Implementing **Supervised Algorithims** and comparing the results of the implemented algorithm with that of the ones produced by Sci-Kit Learn. With the main being predicting Sales Prediction using different Supervised Algorithms.
<br>
<br>
<strong><a href=https://github.com/sanj33krsna/AI-ML-Stuff/tree/main/Plant_Leaf_Disease> Plant Leaf Disease Classification: </a></strong>
<br>
Using **ResNet** type of a CNN, and plant disease data consisting of different leaves, to classify the test data. To understand the working of ResNet using **TensorFlow**. The final result being classification done at 99.2% of the given test data.

## Setup Linux for ML:

#### 1. Install Anaconda:
Install **[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux)** and follow the **[Instructions from here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/linux/)**

#### 2. Creating an Environment:
```bash
conda create -n ml python=3.10.9
```

#### 3. Activating the Enviroment:
```bash
conda activate ml
```

#### 4. Intall the required dependencies:
```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
